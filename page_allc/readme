- No makefile provided.

     - Please write your own makefile! (There are plenty of examples in this
       repository)


- object_alloc.[ch] and page_alloc.[ch] are intended to go into a library.
  Don't put test code in those files.

  Instead, make another C program which demonstrates the functionality of your
  page_alloc and object_alloc.

  Use page_alloc_test.c and object_alloc_test.c for this.


- Your makefile should build the two test programs
  (page_alloc_test and object_alloc_test).
