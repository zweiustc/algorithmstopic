   Modified version of BOTTOM-UP-HEAPSORT
   Ingo Wegener, BOTTOM-UP-HEAPSORT, a new variant of HEAPSORT beating, 
   on an average, QUICKSORT (if n is not very small), Theoretical Computer Science 118 (1993),
   pp. 81-98, Elsevier; n >= 16000 for median-3 version of QUICKSORT

   The idea of delayed reheap after moving the root to its place is from
   D. Levendeas, C. Zaroliagis, Heapsort using Multiple Heaps, in Proc. 2nd Panhellenic
   Student Conference on Informatics -- EUREKA. – 2008. – P. 93–104.
   It saves (n-2)/2 swaps and (n-2)/2 comparisons, for n > 3.
